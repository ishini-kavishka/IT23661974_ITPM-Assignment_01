IT3040 – ITPM Assignment 1

## Project Overview
This project evaluates how accurately SwiftTranslator converts Singlish into Sinhala, including different sentence types, tenses, and mixed-language inputs. It also checks real-time output updates and tests both correct conversions and errors. All tests are automated with Playwright to assess the system’s accuracy, reliability, and usability.
